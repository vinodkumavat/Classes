            <h2> "Matha Pitha Guru Devam" </h2>
            <p>
                The Popular Sanskrit adage sums up the principles that embody Kumavat. At Kumavat, we understand the importance of 
                a Guru's role in helping the student achieve the eternal self-consciousness. It is in a child's pursuit of this eternal truth that
                he encounters success. Kumavat was born out of the sheer determinedness of our core group to fill the vast void left by
                most other educational Institutes in completing each student as a human being. In today's dog eat dog world, where
                competition is at its highest, it is necessary that we prepare our children to face the worst and come out successfully.
                Kumavat is your child's key in this eneavor. Team Kuamavat is composed of young, talented and bright individuals who
                have graduated from premier institutes from across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having personally gone through the grind of preparation, we are fully equipped to educate our students on how to
                maneuver obstacles and scale the peaks of success. We intersct with our students on a personal level and are just a call
                away to help them sort out their problems and issues. We don't want to just teach our students but we want to educate
                them. Every member of faculty realizes that we are facilitators in the transformational journey of our students. We have
                developed a stable approach for your child's preparation which will ensure consistency in results. We provide our
                students with the best material and expose them to numerous tests which would train them to trackle any examination
                with great ease.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are your child's key to a better and successful future. We welcome you to accompany us on this exciting journey. Let
                us be your partner in helping to craft a bright future for your child. We believe we together can make a huge difference
                and will inspire the world to learn and generate leadership quality in learners because leadership can convert the dream
                into reality. We beleive we are the leaders in this field of education. We enrich lives by challenging all student to

                Our missionn is to simplify the concepts, provide handmade notes and give regulare tests. This is to bring self-awareeness
                toward academics and regularity in the student. A student enters KUMAVAT with a motive to achieve top ranks but
                leaves with not only rank but having a fun learning. Admission in KUMAVAT is your only responsibility, the rest is ours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together we can accomplish our mission and travel towards the path of success.
